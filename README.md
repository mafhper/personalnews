## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Bun 1.0+ (recommended) or Node.js 18+
- Modern web browser with ES2022 support

### Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd personal-news

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start development server
bun dev
```

### Build for Production
```bash
# Type checking
bun run type-check

# Production build
bun run build

# Preview production build
bun run preview
```

### GitHub Pages Deployment
This application is fully compatible with GitHub Pages and requires no server-side dependencies:

```bash
