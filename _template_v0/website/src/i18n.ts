        why_p1: "Gradients, transitions, and textures have always been an essential part of my design process. In virtually every project I develop, these visual elements help create atmosphere and identity. But there was a recurring problem: every time I needed a new background, it was starting from scratch.",
        why_p2: "I searched for inspiration, but they rarely fit perfectly. I needed something that was mine, generated on demand, with full control over colors, shapes, and movement.",
        why_p3: "That's how AuraWall was born — a tool I needed myself. But as I developed it, I realized it could be useful for other developers and designers facing the same challenge. That's why, from the start, it was designed to be open source: open code to be studied, adapted, and improved by the community.",
        why_p4: "Today, AuraWall already serves as the background engine on some sites I've produced. The next step is to make access even easier through a public API, allowing any developer to generate procedural wallpapers directly from their projects.",

        why_title: "Por que AuraWall?",
        why_p1: "Gradientes, transições e texturas sempre foram parte essencial do meu processo de design. Em praticamente todo projeto que desenvolvo, esses elementos visuais ajudam a criar atmosfera e identidade. Mas havia um problema recorrente: sempre que precisava de um novo background, era começar do zero.",
        why_p2: "Buscava inspirações, mas elas raramente se encaixavam perfeitamente. Precisava de algo que fosse meu, gerado sob demanda, com controle total sobre cores, formas e movimento.",
        why_p3: "Assim nasceu o AuraWall — uma ferramenta que eu mesmo precisava. Mas ao desenvolvê-la, percebi que poderia ser útil para outros desenvolvedores e designers que enfrentam o mesmo desafio. Por isso, desde o início, foi pensada para ser open source: código aberto para ser estudado, adaptado e melhorado pela comunidade.",
        why_p4: "Hoje, o AuraWall já serve como engine de backgrounds em alguns sites que produzi. O próximo passo é tornar o acesso ainda mais fácil através de uma API pública, permitindo que qualquer desenvolvedor possa gerar wallpapers procedurais diretamente de seus projetos.",

        why_title: "¿Por qué AuraWall?",
        why_p1: "Los gradientes, transiciones y texturas siempre han sido parte esencial de mi proceso de diseño. En prácticamente cada proyecto que desarrollo, estos elementos visuales ayudan a crear atmósfera e identidad. Pero había un problema recurrente: cada vez que necesitaba un nuevo fondo, era empezar desde cero.",
        why_p2: "Buscaba inspiración, pero rara vez encajaban perfectamente. Necesitaba algo que fuera mío, generado bajo demanda, con control total sobre colores, formas y movimiento.",
        why_p3: "Así nació AuraWall — una herramienta que yo mismo necesitaba. Pero al desarrollarla, me di cuenta de que podría ser útil para otros desarrolladores y diseñadores que enfrentan el mismo desafío. Por eso, desde el inicio, fue diseñada para ser open source: código abierto para ser estudiado, adaptado y mejorado por la comunidad.",
        why_p4: "Hoy, AuraWall ya sirve como motor de fondos en algunos sitios que he producido. El próximo paso es facilitar el acceso a través de una API pública, permitiendo que cualquier desarrollador pueda generar wallpapers procedurales directamente desde sus proyectos.",
